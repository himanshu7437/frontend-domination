## 🔑 **Ques-1) What is Event Delegation?**

Event Delegation is a **pattern in JavaScript** where instead of attaching event listeners to multiple child elements, you attach a **single event listener to their parent**.
The parent "listens" for events that bubble up from its children.

---

## ⚡ Why use Event Delegation?

1. ✅ **Performance** → fewer event listeners (better for memory).
2. ✅ **Dynamic elements** → works for elements added later (no need to re-attach).
3. ✅ **Cleaner code** → manage all child events from one place.

---

## 🧩 Example without Event Delegation:

```js
// multiple listeners (not efficient)
document.querySelectorAll('button').forEach(btn => {
  btn.addEventListener('click', () => {
    console.log("Button clicked:", btn.innerText);
  });
});
```

---

## 🧩 Example with Event Delegation:

```js
// one listener on the parent
document.querySelector('#parent').addEventListener('click', (e) => {
  if (e.target.tagName === 'BUTTON') {
    console.log("Button clicked:", e.target.innerText);
  }
});
```

Here:

* We add **one listener to #parent**.
* The event bubbles from `button → parent`.
* We check `e.target` to see which button was clicked.

---

## 🔎 Real-world Example:

Imagine a dynamic list where items are added **after page load**:

```html
<ul id="menu">
  <li>Home</li>
  <li>About</li>
</ul>
<button id="add">Add Item</button>
```

```js
document.querySelector('#menu').addEventListener('click', (e) => {
  if (e.target.tagName === 'LI') {
    console.log("You clicked:", e.target.innerText);
  }
});

document.querySelector('#add').addEventListener('click', () => {
  let li = document.createElement('li');
  li.innerText = "New Item";
  document.querySelector('#menu').appendChild(li);
});
```

✅ Even new `<li>` items will respond to clicks — **thanks to delegation**.

---

## 📝 Interview Definition:

**Event Delegation is a technique where a single event listener is attached to a parent element to manage events of its child elements through event bubbling. It improves performance and works well with dynamically added elements.**

---



### 🔑 **Ques - 2 ) null and undefined**

---

## 🔑 **1. `undefined`**

* A variable that has been **declared but not assigned a value** is automatically `undefined`.
* It means: *"the variable exists, but no value is assigned yet."*

```js
let a;
console.log(a); // undefined (no value assigned)

function test(x) {
  console.log(x); 
}
test(); // undefined (no argument passed)
```

✅ **Default value in JS** → if nothing is assigned, it’s `undefined`.

---

## 🔑 **2. `null`**

* `null` is an **intentional absence of value**.
* It is something you **explicitly assign** to a variable to say: *"this variable should be empty."*

```js
let b = null;
console.log(b); // null (explicitly set to empty)
```

✅ **Used by developers** → to "clear/reset" a variable.

---

## 🔄 **Key Differences Between `null` and `undefined`**

| Feature     | `null`                          | `undefined`                               |
| ----------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Meaning     | Intentional empty value         | Variable declared but not assigned        |
| Type        | `object` (historical bug in JS) | `undefined` (its own type)                |
| Assigned by | Developer (explicitly)          | JavaScript engine (by default)            |
| Example Use | Resetting a variable            | Uninitialized variable / missing argument |

---

## ⚡ Example:

```js
let x;
console.log(x); // undefined (not assigned)

let y = null;
console.log(y); // null (explicitly empty)
```

---

## 🤔 Trick Interview Question:

```js
console.log(typeof null); // "object"  (a bug in JS, should have been "null")
console.log(typeof undefined); // "undefined"
```

👉 So `null` is actually an **object** type (because of a 25+ year old bug in JS), while `undefined` has its **own type**.

---


### 🔑 **Ques - 3 ) Purpose of Closures in JavaScript**

A **closure** is created when a function "remembers" the variables from its **outer scope**, even after that outer function has finished executing.

---

### ✅ Why do we use closures?

1. **Data Privacy / Encapsulation**

   * We can hide variables from the outside world and only allow access through specific functions.

   ```js
   function counter() {
     let count = 0; // private variable

     return {
       increment: function() {
         count++;
         return count;
       },
       decrement: function() {
         count--;
         return count;
       }
     };
   }

   let c = counter();
   console.log(c.increment()); // 1
   console.log(c.increment()); // 2
   console.log(c.decrement()); // 1
   ```

   👉 `count` cannot be accessed directly, only via `increment()` or `decrement()`.

---

2. **Maintaining State**

   * Closures help us "remember" values between function calls.

   ```js
   function greet(name) {
     return function(message) {
       return `Hello ${name}, ${message}`;
     };
   }

   let greetRahul = greet("Rahul");
   console.log(greetRahul("Good morning")); // Hello Rahul, Good morning
   console.log(greetRahul("How are you?")); // Hello Rahul, How are you?
   ```

---

3. **Callbacks & Event Handlers**

   * Many event listeners rely on closures to "remember" values.

   ```js
   function setupButton(id) {
     let msg = "Button clicked!";
     document.getElementById(id).addEventListener("click", function() {
       alert(msg); // closure keeps msg alive
     });
   }
   setupButton("myBtn");
   ```

---

4. **Module Pattern (like mini-classes without classes)**

   * Before `class` and `ES6 modules`, closures were used to simulate **modules**.

   ```js
   const Module = (function () {
     let secret = "Hidden Data";

     return {
       getSecret: function() {
         return secret;
       }
     };
   })();

   console.log(Module.getSecret()); // "Hidden Data"
   ```

---

### ⚡ In short:

The **purpose of closure** is to:

* Keep variables **private & secure**.
* Preserve **state** across function calls.
* Enable **callbacks, event handling, and module patterns**.
---

# 🔑 Ques - 4) Prototype Inheritance in JavaScript

---

## 1️⃣ Easy Explanation

👉 In JavaScript, **objects can inherit properties and methods from other objects** through something called the **prototype chain**.

Think of it like this:

* You have a child. If the child doesn’t know the answer, it asks their parent.
* If the parent doesn’t know, they ask *their* parent… and so on.
* This “asking up the chain” is what **prototype inheritance** does in JavaScript.

---

### Example:

```js
let animal = {
  eats: true,
  walk() {
    console.log("Animal walks");
  }
};

let rabbit = {
  jumps: true
};

// make rabbit inherit from animal
rabbit.__proto__ = animal;

console.log(rabbit.eats);  // true (inherited from animal)
rabbit.walk();             // "Animal walks"
```

Here:

* `rabbit` doesn’t have `eats` or `walk`.
* It looks up its **prototype (animal)** and finds them.

---

## 2️⃣ Interview Answer (Crisp)

**Prototype Inheritance** in JavaScript is a feature where objects can inherit properties and methods from another object through the **prototype chain**. If an object cannot find a property, it looks up its prototype until it finds it or reaches `null`.

---

## 3️⃣ Modern Example with `class` (syntactic sugar):

```js
class Animal {
  walk() {
    console.log("Animal walks");
  }
}

class Rabbit extends Animal {
  jump() {
    console.log("Rabbit jumps");
  }
}

let rabbit = new Rabbit();
rabbit.walk(); // from Animal
rabbit.jump(); // from Rabbit
```

👉 Under the hood, `extends` still uses **prototype inheritance**.

---

✅ **One-liner for Interview:**
“Prototype Inheritance allows one object to use the properties and methods of another object via the prototype chain, helping with code reuse and memory efficiency.”

---


---

# 🔑 Ques - 5) Synchronous vs Asynchronous in JavaScript

---

## 1️⃣ Easy Explanation

### Synchronous

* Code runs **line by line**.
* Each line **waits** for the previous one to finish.
* If one task is slow (like a big loop), everything else **stops** until it’s done.

👉 Like standing in a queue — you can’t move until the person in front is done.

```js
console.log("Task 1");
console.log("Task 2");
console.log("Task 3");
// Output: Task 1 → Task 2 → Task 3
```

---

### Asynchronous

* Code **doesn’t block**.
* Long tasks (like fetching data from server, timers, file reading) can run in the background.
* JavaScript **doesn’t wait** for them — it keeps executing other code.
* When the task is ready, its callback/promise is executed.

👉 Like ordering food in a restaurant — you order, then do other things while the chef cooks.

```js
console.log("Task 1");

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("Task 2 (after 2s)");
}, 2000);

console.log("Task 3");

// Output: Task 1 → Task 3 → Task 2
```

---

## 2️⃣ Interview Answer (Crisp)

**Synchronous JavaScript** executes code sequentially, one statement at a time, blocking further execution until the current one finishes.

**Asynchronous JavaScript** allows certain operations (like I/O, API calls, timers) to run in the background. Instead of blocking, they use callbacks, promises, or async/await to handle results later, enabling non-blocking code execution.

---

## 3️⃣ One-liner Examples

* **Synchronous:** Good for simple tasks where order matters.
* **Asynchronous:** Essential for APIs, database queries, file handling, timers — otherwise the page would “freeze.”

---

✅ **One-liner for Interview:**
“Synchronous code runs line by line, blocking further execution, while asynchronous code allows tasks to run in the background and continue execution without waiting.”

---

---

# 🔑 Ques -6) Hoisting in JavaScript

---

## 1️⃣ Easy Explanation

👉 **Hoisting** means:
JavaScript moves **declarations** (not initializations) **to the top of their scope** before execution.

* **Function declarations** are fully hoisted → you can call them before they are defined.
* **`var` variables** are hoisted but initialized with `undefined`.
* **`let` and `const` variables** are also hoisted, but they stay in a **“temporal dead zone” (TDZ)** until their line is reached → using them before declaration causes an **error**.

---

## 2️⃣ Code Examples

### 🟢 Function Hoisting

```js
sayHello(); // ✅ Works

function sayHello() {
  console.log("Hello!");
}
```

---

### 🟡 Var Hoisting

```js
console.log(a); // ✅ undefined (hoisted but not assigned)
var a = 10;
```

---

### 🔴 Let/Const Hoisting

```js
console.log(b); // ❌ ReferenceError (TDZ)
let b = 20;
```

---

## 3️⃣ Interview Answer (Crisp)

“Hoisting is JavaScript’s default behavior of moving **declarations** to the top of their scope before execution. Functions are fully hoisted, `var` is hoisted but initialized as `undefined`, and `let`/`const` are hoisted but remain in the temporal dead zone until defined.”

---

## 4️⃣ One-liner

👉 “Declarations are hoisted, but initializations are not.”

---
---

# 🔑 Ques - 7) Different Ways of Creating Objects in JavaScript

---

## 1️⃣ Object Literal (most common & simplest)

```js
const person = {
  name: "Rahul",
  age: 22,
  greet: function() {
    console.log("Hello!");
  }
};
```

## ✅ Best when you need a simple object.

## 2️⃣ Using `new Object()` (constructor)

```js
const car = new Object();
car.brand = "Tesla";
car.model = "Model S";
```

## ⚠️ Less common, same as object literal but longer.

## 3️⃣ Constructor Function

```js
function Person(name, age) {
  this.name = name;
  this.age = age;
}
const p1 = new Person("Rahul", 22);
```

## ✅ Used for creating **multiple similar objects** before ES6 classes.

## 4️⃣ ES6 Class

```js
class Person {
  constructor(name, age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }
}
const p2 = new Person("Rahul", 22);
```

## ✅ Cleaner & modern way → preferred in today’s development.

## 5️⃣ `Object.create()` (prototype-based)

```js
const proto = {
  greet() {
    console.log("Hello!");
  }
};

const student = Object.create(proto);
student.name = "Rahul";
```

## ✅ Useful when you want to create an object with a specific **prototype**.

## 6️⃣ Factory Function

```js
function createUser(name, age) {
  return {
    name,
    age,
    greet() {
      console.log(`Hi, I’m ${name}`);
    }
  };
}

const user = createUser("Rahul", 22);
```

## ✅ Similar to constructor but **doesn’t use `new`**.

# 🎯 Interview-Friendly Answer

“There are several ways to create objects in JavaScript:

* **Object literal** (most common),
* **`new Object()`**,
* **Constructor functions**,
* **ES6 Classes**,
* **`Object.create()`** for prototype inheritance, and
* **Factory functions**.

In real-world apps, object literals and classes are most commonly used.”

---

---

# 🔑Ques - 8) `this` in JavaScript

👉 **Definition (Interview Friendly):**
`this` refers to the **object that is currently calling/executing the function**.
Its value depends on **how** (not where) the function is called.

---

## 1️⃣ In the Global Context

```js
console.log(this);
```

* In **browser** → `this` points to the `window` object.
* In **strict mode** → `this` is `undefined`.

---

## 2️⃣ Inside an Object Method

```js
const person = {
  name: "Rahul",
  greet: function() {
    console.log(this.name);
  }
};
person.greet(); // Rahul
```

👉 Here `this` refers to the object (`person`) that calls the method.

---

## 3️⃣ Alone in a Function

```js
function show() {
  console.log(this);
}
show(); // window (or undefined in strict mode)
```

---

## 4️⃣ With `new` (Constructor Function or Class)

```js
function Person(name) {
  this.name = name;
}
const p1 = new Person("Rahul");
console.log(p1.name); // Rahul
```

👉 Inside a constructor/class, `this` refers to the **newly created object**.

---

## 5️⃣ In Arrow Functions 🚀

```js
const person = {
  name: "Rahul",
  greet: () => {
    console.log(this.name);
  }
};
person.greet(); // undefined (or window.name)
```

👉 Arrow functions **don’t have their own `this`**.
They use `this` from the **surrounding lexical scope**.

---

## 6️⃣ With `call`, `apply`, `bind`

```js
function greet(city) {
  console.log(`Hi I am ${this.name} from ${city}`);
}
const user = { name: "Rahul" };

greet.call(user, "Delhi");   // Hi I am Rahul from Delhi
greet.apply(user, ["Mumbai"]); // Hi I am Rahul from Mumbai
const bound = greet.bind(user, "Bangalore");
bound(); // Hi I am Rahul from Bangalore
```

👉 These methods **explicitly set** `this`.

---

# 🎯 Interview Answer (Simple & Clear)

“In JavaScript, `this` refers to the object that is executing the function.
Its value depends on how the function is called:

* In global → `window` (or `undefined` in strict mode).
* Inside object methods → that object.
* In constructors/classes → the new object created.
* Arrow functions → don’t have their own `this`, they use the parent scope’s `this`.
  We can also manually set `this` using `call`, `apply`, or `bind`.”

---
---

# 🔑 Ques - 9) Promises in JavaScript

👉 **Definition (Interview Friendly):**
A **Promise** is an object that represents the eventual **completion or failure** of an asynchronous operation.
It helps us handle async code in a **cleaner and more readable** way than callbacks.

---

## 1️⃣ States of a Promise

A Promise can be in **three states**:

1. **Pending** → initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.
2. **Fulfilled** → operation completed successfully.
3. **Rejected** → operation failed.

---

## 2️⃣ Example

```js
const myPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  let success = true;

  if (success) {
    resolve("✅ Task completed!");
  } else {
    reject("❌ Task failed!");
  }
});

myPromise
  .then(result => console.log(result)) // when resolved
  .catch(error => console.log(error)) // when rejected
  .finally(() => console.log("Done"));
```

---

# 🔄 Callbacks vs Promises

| Feature            | Callbacks                             | Promises                              |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Definition**     | Function passed into another function | Object that represents a future value |
| **Readability**    | Callback hell (nested) 😵             | Cleaner `.then().catch()` chain ✅     |
| **Error Handling** | Must handle manually in each callback | Built-in `.catch()` for errors ✅      |
| **Chaining**       | Hard to chain multiple async ops      | Easy chaining with `.then()` ✅        |
| **Control Flow**   | Can get messy in large apps           | More predictable & structured         |

---

## Example: Callback vs Promise

### ❌ Callback Hell

```js
doTask1(() => {
  doTask2(() => {
    doTask3(() => {
      console.log("All done!");
    });
  });
});
```

### ✅ Promise Chain

```js
doTask1()
  .then(doTask2)
  .then(doTask3)
  .then(() => console.log("All done!"))
  .catch(err => console.log(err));
```

---

# 🎯 Interview Answer (Simple & Clear)

“In JavaScript, **promises** are used to handle asynchronous operations in a cleaner way.
They represent a value that will be available **now, later, or never**.
Unlike callbacks that often lead to **callback hell**, promises allow us to write async code in a structured way with `.then`, `.catch`, and `.finally`.
Error handling and chaining are also much easier with promises.”

---

---

# 🔄 Ques - 10) Event Loop in JavaScript

👉 **Definition (Interview friendly):**
The **event loop** is a mechanism in JavaScript that allows it to perform **non-blocking asynchronous operations** despite being **single-threaded**.
It continuously checks the **Call Stack** and the **Callback Queue / Microtask Queue** to decide what to execute next.

---

## 1️⃣ How JS executes code

* JavaScript is **single-threaded** → it has **one Call Stack**.
* To handle async tasks (like `setTimeout`, promises, fetch etc.), the **Web APIs** & **Queues** come into play.

---

## 2️⃣ Flow of Event Loop

1. JS runs code line by line in the **Call Stack**.
2. If it finds async code (e.g., `setTimeout`), that code is given to **Web APIs**.
3. When async work is done, the callback/promise is moved to:

   * **Callback Queue** → e.g., `setTimeout`, DOM events.
   * **Microtask Queue** → e.g., Promises, `queueMicrotask`.
4. The **event loop** keeps checking:

   * If Call Stack is empty → take from **Microtask Queue first**.
   * If Microtask Queue is empty → take from **Callback Queue**.
5. This cycle keeps running → That’s the **Event Loop**.

---

## 3️⃣ Example

```js
console.log("Start");

setTimeout(() => console.log("Timeout"), 0);

Promise.resolve().then(() => console.log("Promise"));

console.log("End");
```

### Output:

```
Start
End
Promise
Timeout
```

👉 Why?

* `console.log("Start")` → sync → runs immediately.
* `setTimeout(...,0)` → async → goes to **Callback Queue**.
* `Promise.resolve().then(...)` → async → goes to **Microtask Queue**.
* `console.log("End")` → sync → runs.
* Event Loop sees Call Stack empty → runs **Microtask Queue first** → `"Promise"`.
* Then runs **Callback Queue** → `"Timeout"`.

---

# 🎯 Interview Answer (Crisp)

“JavaScript is single-threaded, so it uses the **event loop** to handle asynchronous code.
The event loop keeps checking the **call stack** and processes tasks from the **microtask queue (promises)** first, and then from the **callback queue (like setTimeout)**.
This allows JavaScript to perform non-blocking operations efficiently.”

---

---

# 🚀 Ques 11) Strategies to Improve JavaScript Performance

### 1️⃣ Minimize DOM Manipulations

* **Why?** Direct DOM changes are slow.
* **How?**

  * Batch DOM updates (use `documentFragment`, or update all at once).
  * Use `innerHTML` instead of multiple `.appendChild()` calls.
  * Cache DOM selectors instead of calling `document.querySelector` repeatedly.

---

### 2️⃣ Use Debouncing & Throttling

* **Why?** Avoid running heavy functions on every event (like scroll, resize, keypress).
* **How?**

  * **Debounce:** Execute after a delay (good for search input).
  * **Throttle:** Limit function calls per interval (good for scroll events).

---

### 3️⃣ Optimize Loops & Functions

* Avoid nested loops if possible.
* Use modern methods like `.map()`, `.filter()`, `.reduce()` (but also know they create new arrays).
* Keep functions **pure** and **small**.

---

### 4️⃣ Use Asynchronous Programming

* Offload long-running tasks with **Promises / async-await**.
* Use **Web Workers** for heavy computations so the UI doesn’t freeze.

---

### 5️⃣ Lazy Loading & Code Splitting

* Load only what’s needed:

  * Lazy load images.
  * Split JavaScript bundles so the browser doesn’t load everything at once.

---

### 6️⃣ Minify & Compress

* Minify JS, CSS (remove whitespaces, shorten names).
* Use Gzip or Brotli compression on the server.

---

### 7️⃣ Cache Smartly

* Use **localStorage/sessionStorage** or IndexedDB for caching data.
* Cache API responses (e.g., with Service Workers).

---

### 8️⃣ Avoid Memory Leaks

* Remove event listeners when not needed.
* Nullify references to unused objects.

---

### 9️⃣ Use Efficient Data Structures

* Use Maps/Sets for lookups instead of arrays when dealing with large data.

---

### 🔟 Use Modern JS Features

* Use `const` & `let` (better scoping).
* Use ES6+ features like `async/await` for cleaner async handling.

---

# 🎯 Crisp Interview Answer:

“To improve JavaScript performance, I would minimize DOM manipulations, use techniques like **debouncing/throttling** for event handling, apply **lazy loading and code splitting**, and optimize loops and functions.
I’d also leverage **caching, asynchronous programming, and modern JS features**, while ensuring memory leaks are avoided.
Overall, the idea is to reduce unnecessary work and make the browser handle tasks more efficiently.”

---
---

# 🔑 Ques - 12) `var`, `let`, and `const` in JavaScript

### 1️⃣ **var**

* **Scope** → Function-scoped (visible inside the whole function).
* **Hoisting** → Hoisted to the top but **initialized as `undefined`**.
* **Re-declaration** → Allowed. we can redeclare the var with the same name, it will override the value of previous one.
* **Example:**

  ```js
  function test() {
    console.log(a); // undefined (hoisted)
    var a = 10;
    console.log(a); // 10
  }
  test();
  ```

---

### 2️⃣ **let**

* **Scope** → Block-scoped (only inside `{}` where it’s declared).
* **Hoisting** → Hoisted but in **Temporal Dead Zone** (can’t access before declaration).
* **Re-declaration** → ❌ Not allowed in the same scope.
* **Example:**

  ```js
  {
    let x = 20;
    console.log(x); // 20
  }
  // console.log(x); // ❌ Error (not accessible outside block)
  ```

---

### 3️⃣ **const**

* **Scope** → Block-scoped (same as `let`).
* **Hoisting** → Hoisted but also in **Temporal Dead Zone**.
* **Re-declaration** → ❌ Not allowed.
* **Re-assignment** → ❌ Not allowed.
* **BUT:** Objects/arrays inside `const` can be **modified**.
* **Example:**

  ```js
  const y = 30;
  // y = 40; ❌ Error (can’t reassign)

  const arr = [1, 2, 3];
  arr.push(4); // ✅ Allowed
  console.log(arr); // [1, 2, 3, 4]
  ```

---

# 🎯 Crisp Interview Answer:

* **`var`** is function-scoped, hoisted, and can be re-declared.
* **`let`** is block-scoped, hoisted but in a temporal dead zone, and cannot be re-declared.
* **`const`** is also block-scoped, but variables cannot be re-assigned. However, objects and arrays declared with `const` can still be mutated.

---

---
# Ques - 13) double equals to and triple equals to?
## ✅ Double Equal `==`

* **Checks only value**, **ignores type** (does type conversion automatically).
* This is called **type coercion**.

Example:

```js
console.log(5 == '5');   // true ✅ (value same, type ignored)
console.log(0 == false); // true ✅ (0 is falsy)
console.log(null == undefined); // true ✅
```

---

## ✅ Triple Equal `===`

* **Checks both value AND type**.
* No type conversion.

Example:

```js
console.log(5 === '5');   // false ❌ (number vs string)
console.log(0 === false); // false ❌ (number vs boolean)
console.log(5 === 5);     // true ✅ (same value, same type)
```

---

## 🎯 Interview Answer:

👉 "`==` compares values but does type conversion if types are different.
👉 `===` compares both value and type without conversion, so it’s safer and recommended."

---

⚡ Quick Example you can give in interview:

```js
"5" == 5   // true
"5" === 5  // false
```

---
---

# ✅ Ques - 14) How to Handle Errors in JavaScript

### 1. **Using `try...catch`**

* Used to catch runtime errors so the app doesn’t crash.

```js
try {
    let result = 10 / x;  // ❌ x is not defined
    console.log(result);
} catch (error) {
    console.error("Something went wrong:", error.message);
}
```

👉 **Interview point:** `"try...catch" prevents the script from breaking when an error occurs.`

---

### 2. **Using `throw`**

* You can create **custom errors**.

```js
function divide(a, b) {
    if (b === 0) {
        throw new Error("Cannot divide by zero");
    }
    return a / b;
}

try {
    console.log(divide(10, 0));
} catch (err) {
    console.error(err.message);
}
```

---

### 3. **Using `finally`**

* Runs **always**, whether there’s an error or not (used for cleanup).

```js
try {
    console.log("Trying...");
    throw new Error("Oops!");
} catch (err) {
    console.log("Caught:", err.message);
} finally {
    console.log("This will always run ✅");
}
```

---

### 4. **Handling Errors in Promises**

```js
fetch("wrong-url")
    .then(res => res.json())
    .catch(err => console.error("Fetch error:", err));
```

---

### 5. **Handling Errors in Async/Await**

```js
async function getData() {
    try {
        let res = await fetch("wrong-url");
        let data = await res.json();
        console.log(data);
    } catch (err) {
        console.error("Async error:", err.message);
    }
}
getData();
```

---

## 🎯 Interview Answer (short & clear):

👉 *"In JavaScript, we handle errors using `try...catch...finally` for synchronous code, and `.catch()` or `try...catch` inside async/await for asynchronous code. We can also throw custom errors using `throw`. This prevents the application from crashing and allows graceful handling."*

#  Ques - 15)  `call`, `apply`, and `bind` in JavaScript

All three are used to **control the value of `this`** when calling a function.

---

### 1. **`call()`**

👉 Immediately calls the function with a given `this` value and arguments **separately**.

```js
function greet(city, country) {
    console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}, I live in ${city}, ${country}`);
}

const person = { name: "Rahul" };

greet.call(person, "Delhi", "India");
```

📌 Output:
`Hello, my name is Rahul, I live in Delhi, India`

---

### 2. **`apply()`**

👉 Same as `call()`, but arguments are passed as an **array**.

```js
greet.apply(person, ["Mumbai", "India"]);
```

📌 Output:
`Hello, my name is Rahul, I live in Mumbai, India`

---

### 3. **`bind()`**

👉 Does **not call immediately**. Instead, it returns a **new function** with `this` bound permanently.

```js
const newGreet = greet.bind(person, "Bangalore", "India");
newGreet();   // Call later
```

📌 Output:
`Hello, my name is Rahul, I live in Bangalore, India`

---

## 🎯 Easy Interview Answer:

👉 \*"`call`, `apply`, and `bind` are used to set the `this` context of a function.

* `call` invokes the function immediately with arguments passed one by one.
* `apply` is the same but takes arguments as an array.
* `bind` returns a new function with `this` fixed, which can be called later."\*

---

💡 **Analogy to remember:**

* `call` → Call me now 📞 (separate arguments)
* `apply` → Apply as a form 📝 (arguments in an array)
* `bind` → Bind for later ⏳ (new function to call later)

# ✅ Ques - 16) `filter`, `map`, `reduce` in JavaScript

These are **higher-order functions** on arrays.
They **do not change the original array**, instead return a new one (except reduce, which returns a single value).

---

### 1. **`filter()`**

👉 Used to **filter out** elements based on a condition. Returns a **new array**.

```js
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];

// Get only even numbers
const evens = numbers.filter(num => num % 2 === 0);

console.log(evens); // [2, 4, 6]
```

---

### 2. **`map()`**

👉 Used to **transform** each element. Returns a **new array** of the same length.

```js
// Square each number
const squares = numbers.map(num => num * num);

console.log(squares); // [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36]
```

---

### 3. **`reduce()`**

👉 Used to **reduce** the array into a **single value** (sum, product, max, etc).

```js
// Sum of all numbers
const sum = numbers.reduce((acc, num) => acc + num, 0);

console.log(sum); // 21
```

📌 Parameters in `reduce`:

* `acc` → accumulator (stores result)
* `num` → current element
* `0` → initial value of accumulator

---

## 🎯 Easy Interview Answer:

\*"`filter`, `map`, and `reduce` are functional programming methods in JavaScript:

* `filter` → selects elements that satisfy a condition,
* `map` → transforms each element,
* `reduce` → reduces the array to a single value.
  They make code shorter, cleaner, and avoid manual loops."\*

---

💡 **Analogy to remember:**

* `filter` → Pick only what you need (like filtering spam emails).
* `map` → Transform things (like changing all names to uppercase).
* `reduce` → Summarize everything (like getting total expenses).

# ✅ Ques - 17) Event Bubbling & Event Capturing in JavaScript

Whenever you click (or trigger an event) on an element, the event doesn’t just stay there —
it travels through the DOM tree in **phases**.

---

### 🔹 Phases of Event Flow:

1. **Capturing Phase (Event Capturing / Trickle Down)**
   Event goes **from the root (`window`/`document`) → down to the target element**.

2. **Target Phase**
   Event reaches the actual target element you clicked.

3. **Bubbling Phase (Event Bubbling / Bubble Up)**
   Event goes **from the target element → back up to the root**.

---

### 🔹 Example:

```html
<div id="parent">
  <button id="child">Click Me</button>
</div>
```

```js
document.getElementById("parent").addEventListener("click", () => {
  console.log("Parent clicked");
}, false); // bubbling phase (default)

document.getElementById("child").addEventListener("click", () => {
  console.log("Child clicked");
}, false);
```

👉 If you click the **button**, output:

```
Child clicked
Parent clicked
```

(because bubbling → child first, then parent)

---

### 🔹 Capturing Example:

```js
document.getElementById("parent").addEventListener("click", () => {
  console.log("Parent clicked (capturing)");
}, true); // true → capturing phase
```

👉 Now if you click the button, output:

```
Parent clicked (capturing)
Child clicked
```

---

### 🎯 Easy Interview Answer:

*“Event bubbling means the event goes from the target element up through its ancestors.
Event capturing means the event goes from the root down to the target.
By default, JavaScript uses bubbling, but we can enable capturing by passing `true` in `addEventListener`.
Understanding this helps us control which element handles the event first.”*

---

💡 **Analogy to remember:**

* Capturing = **Parents check first** (“Is someone clicking my kid?”).
* Bubbling = **Child reacts first**, then passes the message up to parents.

# ✅ Ques - 18) Callbacks in JavaScript

### 🔹 What is a Callback?

A **callback** is simply a function passed as an argument to another function,
and it is **executed later**, usually after some task is completed.

👉 In short:

> “A callback is a function that gets called back at a later time.”

---

### 🔹 Example (Basic)

```js
function greet(name, callback) {
  console.log("Hello, " + name);
  callback(); // calling the function passed
}

function sayBye() {
  console.log("Goodbye!");
}

greet("Rahul", sayBye);
```

**Output:**

```
Hello, Rahul
Goodbye!
```

Here, `sayBye` is a **callback function**.

---

### 🔹 Example (Real-life Async Use)

```js
console.log("Start");

setTimeout(function() {
  console.log("Data fetched!");
}, 2000);

console.log("End");
```

**Output:**

```
Start
End
Data fetched!   // after 2 seconds
```

👉 The function inside `setTimeout` is a **callback**, executed later.

---

### 🎯 Interview Style Answer:

*"A callback in JavaScript is a function passed into another function as an argument, which is executed later.
Callbacks are commonly used in asynchronous tasks like reading files, making API requests, or timers.
They allow us to run some code only after an operation is completed."*

---

### 🔹 Problem with Callbacks → "Callback Hell"

When callbacks are nested too deeply, code becomes hard to read:

```js
getUser(function(user) {
  getPosts(user.id, function(posts) {
    getComments(posts[0].id, function(comments) {
      console.log(comments);
    });
  });
});
```

👉 That’s why **Promises** and **async/await** were introduced — to make code cleaner.

---

💡 **Easy way to explain in interviews:**

* Callbacks = pass a function to another function.
* Useful for async operations.
* But too many callbacks → messy → solved by Promises/async-await.

---
---

# ✅ Ques - 19) How JavaScript Handles Asynchronous Code

### 🔹 Key Point:

JavaScript is **single-threaded** (it can run one thing at a time).
So how does it still handle async tasks like **setTimeout**, **fetch API calls**, or **event listeners**?

👉 The answer: **Event Loop + Web APIs + Callback Queue.**

---

### 🔹 Flow (Simple Explanation)

1. **Call Stack**

   * Where JS runs code line by line.
   * If a function is called → pushed onto the stack.
   * When finished → popped off.

2. **Web APIs (Browser features)**

   * Async tasks like `setTimeout`, `fetch`, DOM events are handled by the browser.
   * Example: `setTimeout` waits in the background (handled by Web API, not blocking JS).

3. **Callback Queue (or Task Queue)**

   * Once async task finishes, its callback is pushed into the **queue**, waiting to run.

4. **Event Loop**

   * Constantly checks: “Is the Call Stack empty?”
   * If yes → takes a task from the **queue** and pushes it to the Call Stack.

👉 That’s how async code executes *after* synchronous code.

---

### 🔹 Example

```js
console.log("Start");

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("Async Task Done");
}, 2000);

console.log("End");
```

**Execution Order:**

1. `Start` → printed immediately.
2. `setTimeout` registered in Web APIs (2 sec timer).
3. `End` → printed (stack still free).
4. After 2 sec, callback `console.log("Async Task Done")` goes to the **queue**, then Event Loop pushes it to stack.
5. Prints → `Async Task Done`.

**Output:**

```
Start
End
Async Task Done
```

---

### 🎯 Interview-Ready Answer:

*"JavaScript is single-threaded, but it handles asynchronous code using the event loop.
When an async operation (like setTimeout, fetch, or DOM event) is encountered, it is delegated to the browser’s Web APIs.
Once it completes, its callback is added to the callback queue. The event loop continuously checks if the call stack is empty, and if so, moves the callback into the stack for execution.
This way, async code doesn’t block the main thread."*

---

⚡ Tip: If asked to **draw**, sketch this small diagram:

```
Code → Call Stack → Web APIs → Callback Queue → Event Loop → Back to Call Stack
```
